Chess webapp, with stockfish integration
Built for siege week 4 (practice) on hackclub. All it does is allow you to play chess on a super simple website with either yourself or stockfish. Although, I'm making this so that I can fiddle around with stockfish a bit...

The entire point of this project is to help me in making more interactive websites and give me some experience in how to integrate opensource stuff in them.
