Chess webapp, with stockfish integration
Built for siege week 4 (practice) on hackclub. All it does is allow you to play chess on a super simple website with either yourself or stockfish. Although, I'm making this so that I can fiddle around with stockfish a bit...

The entire point of this project is to help me in making more interactive websites and give me some experience in how to integrate opensource stuff in them.
## Devlogs:
- 23 Sept 2025
    - Created the project
    - Added index.html, style.css, and app.js files and updated base code
    - Made a square chess board along with movable pieces
        - Currently they're just letters, but we'll see if I can design some of them...
    - Added square number/alphabets to the board
        - Will alternate in colours, depending on which colour square they are on
